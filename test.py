a = '''OK IN THE LAST LECTURE WE HAVE LEARNED WHAT IS THE ANALOGY BEHIND THE BEGO NOTATION NOW HERE WE WILL LOOK AT DIFFERENT NOTATIONS THAT ARE USED IN ACADEMICS TO DESCRIBE WRONG TIMES BUT IN THE NURSERY PEOPLE TEND TO USE BIGO TO UNDERSTAND DIFFERENT NOTATIONS THAT ARE USED TO
 MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF ALGRIDIM LET'S LOOK AT REAL LIFE EXAMPLE OK LET'S SAY WE WANT TO BUY BRAND NEW CAR AND OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF CAR WHICH MEANS THAT WE ARE INTERESTED HOW MANY LITTERS OF PETROL IT TAKES TO DRIVE HUNDRED MILE
 NOW IN CASE OF A CAR THERE IS NOT A STANDAR
 
 
 D ANSWER FOR THIS QUESTION EVEN THOUGH IN ANY CAR'S MANUAL IT MIGHT MENTION THAT IT TAKES FOR EXAMPLE SEVENTY LETERS OF PETROL FOR HUNDRED MILE THIS INFORMATION IS NOT DIRECT BECAUSE A CAR CAN PERFORM DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE CONDITION THIS NUMBER CAN BE DIFFERENT BASED ON WHICH CONDITION YOU ARE DRIVING THE CAR SO IF WE DRIVE THE CAR IN THE CITY TRAFFIC IT'S OBVIOUS THAT IT TAKES MORE PETROL TO REACH A HUNDRED MILE THAN WHEN WE DRIVE IT ON THE HIGHWAY AND THERE MIGHT BE STUATION IN WHICH WE DRIVE A CAR IN MIXED CONDITION BOTH TRAFFIC AND HIGHWAY LET'S IMAGINE THAT IT TAKES TWENTY LITTERS TO DRIVE HUNDRED MILES IN THE CITY TRAFFIC AND TEN LITTERS ON THE HIGHWAY AND FIFTEEN LITTERS IN MIXED CONDITION SO HERE WE SEE THAT THE SAME CAR CAN PERFORM DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE CONDITION THAT WE DRIVE IT SIMILARLY ALGRIDM CAN PERFORM DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE CONDITION THAT IS GIVEN WE HAVE SERIE SENARIUS IN CASE OF MEASURING OF ANY GIVEN ALGRATING THESE ARE THE BEST CASE THE FIRST CASE AND THE AVERAGE CASE LET'S SAY FOR ANALGARATIN IT TAKES ONE MINUTE TX GET IN THE VIRST CASE SENARIO IN THE BEST CASE CENARIO IT TAKES JUST FIVE SECONDS TO EXECUTE AND IN FINALLY IN THE AVERAGE CASE SCENARIA IT TAKES THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE SECONDS AKIT SO WITH THE HELP OF THIS RE NOTATION WE CAN DEFINE THE BEST THE WORST AND AVERAGE CASE OF ALBARISM AS AN EXAMPLE LET'S EXAMINE QUIK SORT OFGARISM THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT IS QUICKSHOT OGREDIM YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT BECAUSE I'LL PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION IN SORTING ALGERTIM SECTION ABOUT IT BUT NOW YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW THAT IT'S AN AUGARY DIN THAT SORT'S AN ALTERAD LIST BASED ON THE SELECTION OF RANDOM NUMBER AS A PRIVATE NUMBER AND SE UP GREATER VALUES LET'S LOOK AT THIS EXAMPLE OVER HERE THE MAKES THINGS VERY CLEAR THE FIRST OPERATION IN THIS ASSORTED LIST TARGETS THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS AND THE NUMBER IS CHOSEN AS A REFERENCE FOR SORTING WHICH IS CALLED PRIVATE IT IS CHOSEN AT RANDOM THIS TIME FOR CONVENIENCE LET'S CHOOSE THE RIGHTMOST NUMBER AS THE PILOT HERE IN OUR CASE WHICH IS FIVE THE NEXT THING THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS TO PLACE LEFT MARKER AND RIGHT MARKER LEFT IS ON THE LEFT MOST NUMBER AND RIGHT IS ON THE RIGHT MOST NUMBER GUIEK SORT USES THESE MARKERS TO REPEATEDLY PERFORM RANCO OPERS OPERATIONS RECURSIVELY THE LEFT MARKER MOVES TO THE RIGHT IN EACH STEP AND COMPARES THE NUMBER WITH THE PRIVATE NUMBER AND STOPS WHEN IT REATS A NUMBER THAT IS GREATER OR EQUAL TO THE PRIVATE NUMBER IN OUR CASE IT STOPPED IN THE FIRST CASE BECAUSE SIX IS GREATER THAN FIVE WHICH IS PRIVATE NUMBER THEN THE RIGHT MARKER STARTS TO MOVE TO THE LEFT AND THIS TIME WHEN IT REACHES A NUMBER THAT IS LESS THAN PIVATE IN OUR CASE IT STOPS AS THREE WHICH IS LESS THAN FIVE WHEN BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT MARKERS HAVE STOPPED THE MARKES NUMBERS ARE SLAPPED IN OUR CASE SIX SWAPD WITH THREE SO THE OPERATION REPEATS LIKE THIS UNTIL ALL ELEMENTS GET SORTED SO IN THE BEST SCENARIO ALL ELEMENTS ARE EQUAL AND THE PASS OVER THROUGH THE LEAST HAPPENS ONCE SO IN THIS CASE TIME COMPLEXTE WILL BE O N BECAUSE WE ARE PASSING THROUGH ALL ELEMENTS ONLY ONCE AND SO IF WE HAVE ANY ELEMENTS IN THE LEAST OR TIME COMPLEX THE WILL B O M IN THE FIRST CASE IF WE ARE UNLUCKY THE PILOT IS REPEATEDLY BIGGEST AN ELEMENT IN THE ARRAY SO THE TIME COMPLEXITY WILL BE ON SQUARE AND IN THE AVERAGE CASE SOMETIMES THE PRIVATE NUMBER WILL BE VERY HIGH AND SOMETIMES WILL BE VERY LOW BUT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO IN THIS CASE TIME COMPLEXITY WILL BE OR N OGAN OCE HOPEFULLY THIS EXAMPLE MAKES IT CLEAR AND YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD ALL THREE CASES NOW TO EXPRESS DIFFERENT SCENARIOS OF ALGARISM THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT BIGO NOTATIONS THE FIRST ONE IS BIG O IT'S A COMPLEXITY THAT IS GOING TO BE LESS OR EQUAL TO THE VERST CASE FOR EXAMPLE IF WE WANT ASSORT ONE THOUSAND NUMBERS BIG O MEASURES THE MAXIMUM TIME WE NEED FOR DISSORTING LET'S SAY WE NEED MAXIMUM TEN SECONDS TO EXECUTESO AUTORITE THIS MEANS THAT THE EXECUTION WILL NEVER EXCEED TEN SECONDS IT CAN BE EIGHT OR NINE SECONDS BUT IT WILL NEVER BE MORE THAN TEN SECONDS IN CASE OF BIG ONOTATION THEN THE NEXT NOTATION IS BIG AMEGA IT'S A COMPLEXITY THAT IS GOING TO BE AT LEAST MORE THAN THE BEST CASE IT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE BIG ORNOTATION HERE WE MEASURE THE MINIMUM TIME THAT WE NEED TO EXECUTE AN AUGORITEM THERE MUST BE CASES THAT WE WANT TO KNOW MINIMUM TIME OF ALGARATIM EXECUTION WHICH MEANS THAT IF THE BEST SCENARIO FOR THE EXECUTION OF AMALGARITIM IS TWO SECONDS IN TERMS OF BIG OMEGA IT WILL NEVER BE LESS THAN TWO SECONDS FOR EXAMPLE IF WE WANT TO SORT HUNDRED NUMBERS AND WE KNOW THAT IN THE BEST CASE IT TAKES TWO SECONDS IT WILL NEVER BE LESS THAN TWO SECONDS SOMETIMES THIS INFORMATION IS USEFUL FOR US NOW IN TERMS OF EETA IT'S A COMPLEXITY THAT IS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF VERSE AND BASE CASES THIS MEANS THAT IF WE HAVE AN AUGRATI WITH MAXIMUM EXECUTION TIME TEN SECONDS AND MINIMUM EXECUTION TIME TWELVE SECONDS IN TERMS OF BIG HETA THE AVERAGE TIME WILL BE SIX SECONDS FOR EXECUTION OK LET'S LOOK AT A REAL EXAMPLE FOR THIS RENOTATION LET'S IMAGINE THAT WE HAVE AN ARRAY OF ONE MILLION ELEMENTS OVER HERE AND OUR GOAL IS TO FIND A GIVEN NUMBER WITHIN THIS ARRAY IF WE WANT TO SEARCH A NUMBER WHICH IS LOCATED AT THE END OF THIS ARRAY IN OUR CASE WHICH IS NINE WE BASICALLY CHECK EACH ELEMENT ONE BY ONE UNTIL WE FIND THE ELEMENT THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IN THIS CASE WE WILL VISIT ALL ELEMENTS OF THIS ARRAY LET'S SAY THE TIME THAT WE NEED TO VISIT EACH ELEMENT IS ONE MILLA SECOND SO THE TIME THAT WE NEED TO VISIT ALL O ELEMENTS WILL BE AND MULTIPLY WITH ONE WERE N IS THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN THE ARRAY OK HOW CAN WE REPRESENT THIS SEARCHING PROCESS IN TERMS OF E NOTATIONS SO IN TERMS OF BIG O NOTATION IT WILL BE OR END THIS MEANS THAT THE MAXIMUM TIME THAT WE NEED TO FIND ANY GIVEN NUMBER WITHIN THIS ARRAY IS N IT WILL NOT BE MORE THAN THAT AS SHOWN HERE TO FIND THE LAST NUMBER IN THE ARRAY WHICH IS MINE IT TAKES AND MULTIPLY WITH ONE SO IT WILL NOT BE GREATER THAN ON IN TERMS OF BIG OMEGA IT WILL BE OMEGA ONE THIS MEANS THAT THE MINIMUM TIME THAT IS REQUIRED FOR FINDING ANY GIVEN ELEMENT IS ONE IT WILL NOT BE LESS THAN ONE TO FIND ANY GIVEN NUMBER WITHIN THIS ARRAY IN OUR CASE IT WILL NEVER TAKE LESS THAN ONE TO FIND FIRST ELEMENT IN THIS ARRAY IN TERMS OF BIGHETA IT WILL BE HETE AND DIVIDED BY TO THIS IS THE AVERAGE TIME THAT IS NEEDED TO FIND ANY GIVEN NUMBER THIS IS BECAUSE FOR FINDING DIFFERENT NUMBERS WE NEED VARIOUSONS OF TIME SO WE NEED TO TAKE AVERAGE OF THESE NUMBERS WE NEED TO KNOW ALL THESE THREE NOTATIONS FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE INTERVEES WE ONLY NEED BIG O NOTATION 
 AND THAT'S ALL FOR THIS VIDUOL AND HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD THREE DIFFEREN
 T TYPES OF BIG O NOTATIONS'''
